# BARD - Ben's Amateur Radio Database

### Current State:

**Thursday, December 21, 2017:** 'master' is currently dead. Head over to the 'dev' branch to check out current development

**Tuesday, August 8, 2017:** BARD uses only an ncurses-driven command line interface.  For now.



### Install:

You need a c++ compiler, make, ncurses, and probably Linux.  Type 'make' to run the makefile.
