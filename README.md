# BARD - Ben's Amateur Radio Database



## Current State:

**Tuesday, August 6, 2019:** Since I was bad at not letting NCU spiral out of control, it died and is now (eventually) being replaced with BEN (basically new new NCU).

**Thursday, December 21, 2017:** BARD is slowly being brought back to its original state using the new NCU

**Tuesday, August 8, 2017:** BARD uses only an ncurses-driven command line interface.  For now.



## DEV BRANCH

BARD is being redeveloped to hopefully be less hastly written and to also use my improved NCursesUtils library.



### Install:

You need a c++11 compiler, make, ncurses, and probably Linux.  Type 'make' to run the makefile.
