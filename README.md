# BARD
Ben's Amateur Radio Database



Current State:

As of Tuesday, August 8, 2017, BARD uses only an ncurses-driven command line interface.  For now.

## DEV BRANCH

BARD is being redeveloped to hopefully be less hastly written and is also using my improved NCurses Utils library.

Install:

You need a c++11 compiler, make, ncurses, and probably Linux.  Type 'make' to run the makefile.
